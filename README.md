# DevFinder
A full-stack application for new developers and college students to find others with similar interests and skills to collaborate on projects together for their resume and internship or job search. This is a project that I have learned typescript, NextJS, JWT authorization/authentication, developing RESTFUL apis, database shema/optimization, and many more concepts. This is by far the most learning I have done during a project and there have been many challenges, but that is where the learning occurs. The mistakes or techniques that I miss allow me to learn and become more comfortable with the material and really understand it.
